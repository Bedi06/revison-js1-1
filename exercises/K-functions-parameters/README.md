The input given to a function is called a **parameter**.

A function can take more than one parameter:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

When you write a function (sometimes called _declaring a function_) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (`()`). Parameters can be called anything.

This function is exactly the same as the one above:

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

## Exercise 1

- Write a function that adds two numbers together
- Call the function, passing `13` and `124` as parameters, and assigning the returned value to a variable `sum`

## Expected result

```
137
```

## Exercise 2

- Write a function that takes a name (a string) and an age (a number) and returns a greeting (a string)

##Â Expected result

```
Hello, my name is Daniel and I'm 30 years old
```
